# Coding Principles

1.	Consistent indentation：
Write code with a consistent indentation style, following the existing styles used in the project.
2.	Code grouping：
Different functions are placed in separate blocks of code, separated by Spaces.
3.	Consistent naming scheme：
The word boundary of a name is achieved by capitalizing the first letter of each word.
4.	Avoid deep nesting：
Make changes to the code to lower the nesting level and make it easier to read.
5.	Comments and documentation：
Add comments to the function definition so you can preview it when you use it. Functions can be called from third-party libraries.
6.	Principle of dry：
Avoid duplicating data and logic when writing code.
7.	Limit line length：
Avoid writing long horizontal lines and limit the maximum number of characters per line.
8.	Single responsibility：
Every class or module in a program should only concern itself with providing one bit of specific functionality.
9.	Code and data classification：
Use MVC framework to divide the program into three different areas for later maintenance.
10.	 Object orientation and programs：
By creating a good architecture through object-oriented programming, program functions can perform specific tasks independently.
11.	 Avoid premature optimization：
Premature optimization leads to a failure to figure out what the real problem is, which wastes a lot of time speeding up a function that isn't called very often.
12.	 File and folder organization：
Avoid writing complete code in a single file, or function files can be too large and difficult to maintain. Use frameworks to mimic the folder structure.
13.	 Code refactoring：
Refactoring allows you to change code without changing other functionality, improving readability and quality.
14.	 Open/Closed：
Open the code to extend, but not modify. Improved stability and maintainability.
15.	 Capitalize SQL special words：
Distinguish table and column names by uppercase.
